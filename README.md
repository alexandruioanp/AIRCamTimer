AIRCamTimer
===========

A desktop AIR application that takes photos to be later assembled in a time-lapse video, featuring asynchronous image encoding using ActionScript workers and hardware-accelerated StageVideo.

Note
====
Adobe Flash Builder 4.7 includes tooling support for ActionScript workers; otherwise, the worker .swf must be compiled separately and included in the project.
